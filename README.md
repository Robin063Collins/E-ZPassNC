## Description

E-ZPassNC is a modern React-based web application designed to simulate and manage electronic toll payment tracking inspired by North Carolina’s E-ZPass system. The project focuses on simplicity, transparency, and ease of use for users who want to understand toll expenses, manage trip records, and generate digital receipts in a clean interface.

This application demonstrates real-world front-end development concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, reusable UI elements, and responsive styling. E-ZPassNC is ideal for developers learning React, contributors looking to practice collaboration, or anyone interested in building finance or transportation-related web applications.

The project emphasizes clean code, modular structure, and scalability, making it easy to extend with features like user authentication, API integration, or real toll data support.
